= Standbein Readme

== About

Standbein is a lightweight wrapper around JavaFx to provide a starting point for small rich client applications.
The main goals are:

* Use dependency injection (via Guice)
* Split the application into small parts, so called *Activities*, that are disconnected from each other
* Control the lifecycle and threads of activities
* Give the user as much freedom as possible to use or not use the given features (and therefore provide only the essential stuff)

== Testing/using

Currently the standbein library is still in development.
Must of its api is in use since over a year and is considered quite stable.
However I still want to have the possibility to simplify and refactor stuff.

Therefore it is not yet in any maven repository and you have to install it into your local repository:

[source,shell]
$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

This command will install it in you local maven repository: ~/.m2 +

== Features

* *Service infrastructure*: to initialize your infrastructure at startup time (eg. start embedded db, hibernate, weld whatever)
* *Version upgrade detection*: register upgrade from one version to another that are executed on the client (change ddl, extract zipfiles of data)
* *Lifecycle control* via activities (see below)
* slight preferation(or maybe even enforcement) of *MVC* style programming, but you are not bound to
* *Eventbus*: send event from any class to your controllers (or who ever is listening) ...decouple...
* *Validation*: simple validation framework
* *Localization*: define your base localisation properties. Additionally define controller local property files (to avoid the messy 10000+ line files)
* Designed to use dependency injection as much as possible (This is still a UI framework and it depends on JavaFX which hates testability and DI)
* *Binding*: bind labels or textfields (or whatever your stringconverter can handle) to a model property
* *Predefined refresh handling*: If needed you can implement your own datasource which will be loaded on entry of an activity
